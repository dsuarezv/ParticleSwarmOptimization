Particle Swarm Optimization in C#
=================================

Inspired by the solver code in [this article](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2013/11/01/particle-swarm-optimization.aspx) by James Caffrey. I refactored the solver and added the UI so it's easier to see what's happening, at least in 2D functions.
